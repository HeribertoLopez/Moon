COVID-19 is a type of coronavirus that possesses high rates of transmissibility among the human population. For this research project, we investigated how COVID-19 cases change at varying degrees of vaccination rates from a global, country, and state-level perspective. Our purpose was to identify the percentage of people vaccinated needed to begin to see a drop in cases. A variant of the virus,  *Delta*, has recently been reported as having a higher rate of transmissibility among vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals alike. After gathering data for Delta cases, we analyzed how these cases respond to vaccination rates and drew conclusions from our findings.

Video embeds are responsive and scale with the width of the main content block with the help of [FitVids](http://fitvidsjs.com/).

Not sure if this only effects Kramdown or if it's an issue with Markdown in general. But adding YouTube video embeds causes errors when building your Jekyll site. To fix add a space between the `<iframe>` tags and remove `allowfullscreen`. Example below:

{% highlight html %}
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SU3kYxJmWuQ" frameborder="0"> </iframe>
{% endhighlight %}
