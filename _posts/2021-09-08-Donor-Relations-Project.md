# Introduction 

Many Colleges acrooss the U.S. are concerned about donors. However, while donor acquisition efforts are important, donor retention efforts have the ability to greatly increase
the amount of giving to an organization (Sargeant). The frequency of communication with constituents has the potential to affect a donors' decision to continue giving  (Deitz and Kellet).
For this project, we used data from a small liberal arts college and were interested in understanding the behavior of the donors fro this particular college, specifically how
constituent' giving is affected by email communications. After an increase in email communications due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a leading question was how much email communication is too 
much? In out research, we used data from St. Olaf College Advancement's gift database and email database to examine donor engagement and behavior. The data used for the project was from 
St. Olaf's fiscal year 2020 (June 2019 - May 2020).
