I have been commuting frequently to many places around where I live on my e-bike and with summers arrival I have encountered several types of bikers and non-bikers on shared use paths. 
Encountering other bikers isn't always something I look forward to, but it is nice to see new people exercising, and seeing new people take on biking. As someone, who grew up learning how to

found myself biking 

around was bik

seen several more people riding around in there bikes. I always enjoy seeing other
people riding their bikes
