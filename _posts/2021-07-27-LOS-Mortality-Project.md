# Introduction 

LEP patients are patients who do not speak English as their primary language and have demonstrated a limited ability to read, speak, or write English. In 2019, approximatley 60 million of Americans spoke a language other than English at home and 25.9 million individuals were not proficient in speaking, reading, and writing English [1,2,3]. Moreover, the healthcare system in the United States is already diffciult to navigate even for individuals who speak English as their primary language, and barriers increase when limited-English proficiency individuals mesh with the health care system in the absence of an interpreter [4]. Thus, it has been well documented that Limited English Proficiency (LEP) patients, including refugees, experience inequities in our healthcare system. For this project, we were interested in uncovering an opportunity for improvement at our hospital by comparing healthcare outcomes for LEP patients who worked with interpreters to English proficient patients admitted to internal medicine. In, 
LOS, Readmission, Mortality, and Emergency Department Visits (ED). 

# Data and Methodology 

Retrospective chart data from 2013 to 2019 was obtained from Regions Hospital. LEP and English Proficient Patients were matched by age (+/5 years), insurance type, gender, and APRDRG weight (within 0.5).
