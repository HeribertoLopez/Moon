## Overview of ROC

The term “ROC” refers to “receiver operating characteristic”  originationg from radar engineers detecting enemy objects in battlefields. Two radar receiver operating characteristics are 
true postive rate (TPR) and false postive rate (FPR). True positive rate refers to the proportion of predictions from a classifier than are correctly identified: TPR = $\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$ and 
FPR refers to the proportion of negative examples predicted incorrectly: FPR = $\frac{FP}{TN+FP}$. An ROC asseses the performance of a classifier that returns a probability along with a
prediction. 

# get real data for classifying wine
```
wine = load_wine()
X = wine.data
y = wine.target
y = (y == 2).astype(int) # the data have y in {0, 1, 2}: go binary by maping 0 and 1 to 0, 2 to 1
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)
```
