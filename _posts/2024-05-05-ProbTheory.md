Over the past year, I wrapped up my first year as a Masters student in Statistics at the University of Wisconsin. During my first semester, I took a course on mathematical statistics which essentially covered the application of probability theory in order to establish a strong foundation for Statistical Inference, which would be a course I would take later on during the first year. As an undergraduate, I had not yet taken a probability theory course so this was my first introduction to several of the concepts in probability theory and overall I often struggled or felt slow compared to my peers to obtain essential concepts in the class. However, after finishing the first academic year I know that this is something many graduate students feel, especially during the first semester. My overall goal in this post is to briefly introduced the topic of mathematical statistics and some key concepts to understand from probabilty theory. This post functions more so as a way for me to understand the concept better, and learn to explain it better, as a wise professor once said to me, "The best way to learn is to do".
