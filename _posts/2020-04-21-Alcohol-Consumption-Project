# Introduction

Colleges, Universities, and many schools across the world have implemented policies to tackle issues regarding alcohol use on their campuses. Many systems come with an effort to influence students to have control over their drinking habits and enjoy activities without feeling the need to feel inebriated. While schools seem to focus on the social aspects and harmful effects on individuals outside of academic life, researchers have developed a keen interest in the extent of the impact that alcohol has on the academic performance of students. The purpose of this study is to explore how alcohol consumption levels may influence the average final grade of students. 

Research on the effects of alcohol consumption is widely studied. Large areas of studies have focused on the social factors that may lead to binge drinking as students. A study published in 2014, "Just a First-Year Thing? The Relations between Drinking During Orientation Week and Subsequent Academic Year Drinking Across Class Years", gathered undergraduate participants from the University of Otago, New Zealand,  and collected survey data on the student participants for 13 days through daily diaries which included personal amounts of alcohol consumption. The study focused mainly on patterns for event-specific drinking, such as Orientation week. (Riordan, Benjamin, et. all). The results suggested that event-specific drinking is associated with increases in the amount of alcohol consumption across all class years. Similarly, other studies have looked at predictors surrounding alcohol and the association with poor academic achievement through survey and educational data of students (Walid et al.). But to what extent does alcohol influence academic performance?  

Of interest, when looking at the effects of alcohol, are potentially other factors that attributed to a change in academic performance. In the research article, "Legal access to alcohol and academic performance: Who is affected?" Austin and Joung use survey data to compare the average drinks students of legal age consume compared to those of younger generations. The results were similar to other studies where peers of legal drinking age showed a significant increase when obtained the legal drinking age compared to their younger peers.

Based on previous research, we expect that a model for alcohol consumption and final average grades of students will account for variables that have previously associated with the grades. Researchers Joung Yeoub and Austin Smith's model alone accounted for complexity variables such as individual effects on performance and normal variants that can significantly affect the academic grades of a student. Despite complex predictors associated with grades, we expect to uncover significant factors between alcohol consumption levels and the average final grades of students.  

# Methods

Our two datasets were obtained from Kaggle and included data collected thorough surveys from secondary school Portuguese students taking a mathematics course and a language course at two different schools the Gabriel Pereira (GP) and Mousinho da Silveira (MS) schools in Portugal. Our original dataset included a total of 662 students from which 395 students were taking a mathematics course, and 649 were taking a Portuguese language course, with 382 taking both classes. There were no missing variables present, and the average grades for each student were calculated over three academic year semesters. The grading system in Portugal secondary schools are graded differently than in the United States grades and are calculated between a 0 through 20 point scale (A = 20 - 18, B = 17 - 16, C = 15 -14, D = 13-12, E (Sufficient) = 11-10).
